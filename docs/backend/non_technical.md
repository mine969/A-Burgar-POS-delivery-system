# Backend Non-Technical Overview

## The Goal
The Backend is the **"Brain"** of the application. It makes decisions and processes information.

## Your Role
As a Backend Developer, you are responsible for:
1.  **Logic**: Deciding what happens when a user clicks a button.
2.  **Security**: Making sure only the right people can see the right data.
3.  **Speed**: Ensuring the app responds quickly.

## Key Concepts
-   **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Think of this as a **Menu** in a restaurant. The Frontend (Customer) looks at the menu and asks the Backend (Kitchen) for a specific dish (Data).
-   **Statelessness**: The server treats every request as a new one. It doesn't "remember" you between clicks; instead, you show your ID card (Token) every time.
