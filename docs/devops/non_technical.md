# DevOps Non-Technical Overview

## The Goal
The DevOps role is the **"Mechanic"** and **"Traffic Controller"**. You ensure the code written by developers actually runs on the server and stays running.

## Your Role
As a DevOps Engineer, you are responsible for:
1.  **Automation**: Making sure developers don't have to manually copy files to the server.
2.  **Reliability**: Ensuring the server doesn't crash.
3.  **Environment**: Making sure the code runs the same way on a laptop as it does on the cloud.

## Key Concepts
-   **Container (Docker)**: A lunchbox. You put your code, libraries, and settings inside. It runs exactly the same no matter where you open the lunchbox.
-   **Pipeline (Jenkins)**: An assembly line. You put raw code in one end, and a running application comes out the other. It builds, tests, and deploys automatically.
