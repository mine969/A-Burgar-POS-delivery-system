# SQL Non-Technical Overview

## The Goal
The Database is the **"Memory"** or **"Filing Cabinet"** of the application. It stores all the information permanently.

## Your Role
As a Database/SQL Developer, you are responsible for:
1.  **Organization**: Deciding how to categorize data (Users, Orders, Menu Items).
2.  **Integrity**: Ensuring data makes sense (e.g., an Order cannot exist without a Customer).
3.  **Retrieval**: Making sure we can find data quickly.

## Key Concepts
-   **Table**: Like a spreadsheet tab. One for Users, one for Orders.
-   **Row**: A single record (e.g., "John Doe").
-   **Column**: A specific piece of info (e.g., "Email Address").
-   **Relationship**: Connecting two tables. "This Order belongs to That User."
